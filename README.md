# image-pipelines
Image processing pipelines used in the lab

## imageJ-macros
Simple scripts for processing files in batch. Can be installed in [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) so they can be access by the gui menu

## jupyter_notebooks
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) containing the Python code used to process images. I primarily use the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) library in these notebooks. There are some solid examples of basic utilization in the scikit image documentation. Written in python 3.7 

## Functions
A few functions for preprocessing images, to be used in conjunction with skimage
