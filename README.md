# image-pipelines
Image processing pipelines used in the lab


## jupyter_notebooks
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) containing the Python code used to process images. I primarily use the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) library in these notebooks. There are some solid examples of basic utilization in the scikit image documentation. Written in python 3.7 

## Functions
Pipelines for analysis

## Preprocessing
A few functions for preprocessing images (channel subtraction, z-project) and applying skimage functions

### Required Python packages
See requirements.txt
